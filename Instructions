#Instructional Guide on Paper Tower- Thomas Zaccak and Noah Law

Cut paper into 3 peices in three equal sized vertical strips. 
Fold individual strips in half, cut line down the middle of each folded piece, two per paper.
With the cuts, stack paper on top of each other face against each other. 
Make sure the slits go in and link with the other pieces of paper. 
(if needed) Fold the bottom two pieces and place two relatively heavy objects to the bottom to anchor the base.

#Conclusion
This project was a total success and we effectively completed the task.
